Discomfort distance reward is still set to be 0.2 for training, thus will use that number for evaluation rather than 1.2m said in the paper
Maximum speed is capped at 1 in action space, need to increase it to see the model's ability to use lower speed when possible (adherence to a perferred speed rather than going to maximum)
Use 10 humans
Use real human walking data
